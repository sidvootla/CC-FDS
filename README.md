# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Problem Statement
Develop an efficient credit card fraud detection system that employs machine learning techniques to accurately identify and prevent fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives, ensuring the security of genuine transactions and providing a seamless user experience.

## Requirements
* pandas
* numpy
* sci-kit learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn

##  Defining Data
There are 28 features in the sample data starting from V1, V2, V3,..., V28
The number of transactions in total are 284,807
There is a column 'Class' which has values 0 or 1 - 0 means the transaction is genuine and 1 means the transaction is fraudulent

## Data Visualization
We use sci-kit learn and seaborn for data visualization 

## Conclusion 
After building the model, we were able to find out 492 number of frauds from 284,807 transactions
The accuracy of our model is 99.8%
Since Oversampling of data has occured, we have to use methods to overcome this problem
